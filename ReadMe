Repository

This repository contains 3 further files:
run_analysis.R - the script to create the tidy dataset
tidy.txt - the tidy dataset itself
CodeBook - description of the Variables and measures of the tidy dataset


Transformations
The run_analysis.R script should be run on the data (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) 
and it will complete the following steps to transform the data into a tidy dataset.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
